## This code is a Python script that simulates the motion of a spacecraft in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) using the -- method for numerical integration.

#imports libraries needed, runge kutta integration?

#define function to set constants: orrbit properities 

#set initial conditions and initial condition vector/array

#use integration method and EOM to propagate a new state vector 

#for loop to propagate state vector for a set number of iterations

#plot results
